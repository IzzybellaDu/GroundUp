# GroundUp â€“ Community Proposal Platform  

A full-stack web application with a React frontend and a Flask backend, designed to give communities a voice in shaping the future of their cities.  

## Inspiration  

We believe that cities of the future are built by those who live and interact with them daily. Despite government projects impacting communities each year and issues with city infrastructure, there are currently very few ways to provide meaningful input.  

This inspired us to create **GroundUp**, a platform that allows residents to view, support, and propose projects that impact their neighborhoods. By making decision-making more transparent, communities can influence where taxpayer money is spent and ensure local priorities are heard.  

## What It Does  

- Browse current projects in various stages, from proposal to progress  
- Filter projects based on **location** and **category**  
- Upvote proposals to highlight initiatives that matter most to the community  
- Suggest new proposals to be reviewed by the appropriate community or government body  

## Getting Started  

Follow these steps to run the application locally.

###  Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  

### 1. Set up the Flask Backend

1.  Navigate to the `flask-server` directory:
    ```bash
    cd flask-server
    ```
    
2. Install or activate a virtual environment
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    (Mac/Linux)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate     (Windows)
    ```

3.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Run the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 2. Set up the React Frontend

1.  In a new terminal, navigate to the `client` directory:
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2.  Install the required npm packages. If you don't have npm install it:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Run the React application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend development server will start on `http://localhost:3000`, and it will automatically open in your default web browser.

The application should now be running, with the React frontend communicating with the Flask backend.
